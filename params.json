It is a collection CSS style sheets containing reusable CSS3. Instead of directly styling your page, it has classes that you can implement into elements to add style information. \r\nEasrWeb includes ready-built classes that make your web design easier. Instead of having to have to do all that `style = \"font-size: 36;\"` You can use an EasrWeb class to do that simple yet annoying style. With EasrWeb you would do: `class=\"Medium\"`. Now you can stop wasting time on basic style work and get to the good stuff. \r\nEasrWeb can also help you arrange your page. Creating 3 text columns using EasrWeb is as easy as `<div class=\"Collumn3\">Lorem ipsum</div> <div class=\"Collumn3\"> Lorem ipsum</div> <div class=\"Column3\">Lorem ipsum</div>` EasrWeb isn't meant to be a complete web design stylesheet. It's just your little helper for that repetitive CSS.","google":""}
